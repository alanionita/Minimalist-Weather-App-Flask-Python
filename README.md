# Minimalist Weather App

Built using this [FreeCodeCamp tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-build-a-web-app-using-pythons-flask-and-google-app-engine-52b1bb82b221/) and the [Flask docs](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/quickstart/)

# Why this project?

After doing a doing a lot of AI engineering recently in Python I wanted to start looking at potential frameworks to also build web UIs for the machine learning models.

This is why I chose [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)

# What will I learn?

- basic MVC app with routing and requests
- handling environment variables
- deploying a Flask application
- deep dive into the Python syntax

# Running the app

## Pre-requisites 

* Python3
* API key from [Open Weather Map](openweathermap.org)

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip3](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install app dependencies.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Start the app

```bash
$ export API_KEY='YOUR_KEY_GOES_HERE'
$ python run-app.py
```
